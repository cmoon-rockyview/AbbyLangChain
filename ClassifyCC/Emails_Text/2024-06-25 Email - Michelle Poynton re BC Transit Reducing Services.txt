Dear Mayor & Council,
I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed elimination of certain transit services in our area. This change will significantly impact my brother, Neil Poynton, who relies on these services for his daily transportation needs.
Neil has a learning disability which makes it essential for him to have access to reliable public transportation. The specific route/service is Bus 7 which is proposed to be reduced is crucial for him to travel to work, medical appointments, and social activities. Without this service, his ability to maintain independence and participate in the community will be severely compromised.
Public transportation is a vital resource for many individuals with disabilities, providing them with the freedom to navigate their communities, attend appointments, and lead fulfilling lives. The proposed service cuts will create substantial hardships not only for my brother but also for many other individuals who depend on these services. 
I kindly urge you to reconsider the decision to eliminate this service. I am confident that there can be alternative solutions that address budgetary constraints without disproportionately affecting vulnerable members of our community. Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in public transportation should be a priority, as it reflects our collective commitment to supporting all members of society.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns. I would be grateful for an opportunity to discuss this matter further and explore potential solutions that could mitigate the impact on my brother and others in similar situations. Please feel free to contact me at 604-217-5255 or poyntonmichelle@gmail.com.
Sincerely,
Michelle Poynton
