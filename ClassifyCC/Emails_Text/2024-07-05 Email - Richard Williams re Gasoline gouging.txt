     Subject: RE: gasoline gouging

     I would like the gouging in Abbotsford to stop, today the prices were cheaper in Vancouver than they were in Abbotsford and as the mayor of Abbotsford I would think that you would have something to say about this...
     I'm not happy to know that our Mayor is not concerned enough to regulate how business is being conducted in Abbotsford BC...
     We are already taxed to death and this is completely out of control when gasoline prices in Abbotsford are higher than Metro Vancouver...
     I have reached out to you in the past, I have sent you emails regarding this problem and just like every other politician, you have pass the buck and told me that you do not control the gas pricing in Abbotsford...
     Notes you are also in the gasoline business... well it's about time our Mayor took interest and the concerns of your voters and started to do something to contain this matter...

     I will no longer vote for you in the future if something is not done about this immediately this year... It's bad enough we have a carbon tax...

     Yours truly Richard Williams
