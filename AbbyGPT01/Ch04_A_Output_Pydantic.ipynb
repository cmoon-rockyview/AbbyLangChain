    "# PydanticOutputParser\n",
    "\n",
    "`PydanticOutputParser` is a class that helps convert the output of a language model into **structured information**. Instead of providing simple text responses, this class can provide the necessary information in a **clear and systematic form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this class, you can transform the output of a language model to fit a specific data model, making it easier to process and utilize the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "`PydanticOutputParser` (and most OutputParsers) should primarily implement **two core methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get_format_instructions()`**: Provides instructions defining the format of the information that the language model should output. For example, it can return a string describing the fields and format of the data that the language model should output. These instructions are crucial for structuring the output and transforming it to fit a specific data model.\n",
    "- **`parse()`**: Takes the output of the language model (assumed to be a string) and parses and transforms it into a specific structure. Using tools like Pydantic, it validates the input string according to a predefined schema and converts it into a data structure that follows that schema.\n",
