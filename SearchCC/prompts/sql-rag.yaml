  Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer. 
  Unless the user specifies in his question a specific number of examples he wishes to obtain, always limit your query to at most {top_k} results. 
  You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
  Use the following format:

  Question: "Question here"
  SQLQuery: "SQL Query to run"
  SQLResult: "Result of the SQLQuery"
  Answer: "Final answer here"

  Only use the following tables:
  {table_info}

  Question: {input}
