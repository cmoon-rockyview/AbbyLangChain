City of Abbotsford:

You have treated my son like he
lost a fingernail but he lost his two front teeth. I wish we never attended this camp and that I lived somewhere else.

You also have lots of resources and count on the fact that the little person - me - will give up or does not have the tenacity to continue.

This whole process makes me sick and the way you have blown my son off will not be forgotten.

You also made it sound like I was trying to get money from you that I didn’t pay. This is highly unethical and insulting to me.  If you read my letter you would see that I was very truthful in my outlining of our medical plans. I NEVER hid things or asked you for past money - that I worked hard to pay for myself and was reimbursed.  I asked you to help my son in the FUTURE with his care. I resent that you suggest to me that I was somehow asking for money I never paid out.  You have treated him unfairly and to expect a 12 year old boy to be fully responsible when boys don’t even develop or mature till way into their 20’s.  Buy your own account the kids were allowed to do this and when you had 1 staff member you told them no ….. but then let them continue anyways?? Something stinks and does not add up here.

Your response and taking no responsibility for your actions is typical of society today. You blame this ALL on a 12 year old!!!!!! Come on. Your staff with their fancy training allowed an unsafe activity and you take no responsibility.
Shameful.
And then you site 1956 case law are you joking !

So the saga continues.

Subject: Bc transit #66 & #21

Good evening,

My name is Mandeep wanted to contact you regarding BC Transit routes #66 and #21.
#66 Fraser Valley Express gets filled up at highstreet heading to carvolth exchange. When that happens me and my work colleagues have to physically run fron highstreet to fraser highway over the mt. Lehman over pass to catch the #21 to aldergrove to catch a translink bus to go to Langley to our work. We have contacted BC transit that hopefully van change where the #21 comes to highstreet before it goes to aldergrove as our second option rather then catching the #66. Not saying to happen right away but please for September when university starts and buses will be more busy and for people like us coming off from summer vacations going back to work. Also the highstreet mall exchange so much room is wasted with concrete that it can be pushed back more to have buses come there like the #21 aldergrove. Also that second stop is not safe as we have seen so many times people almost get hit by cars there. There is no side walk there it's not safe for the crosswalk. Also the new crosswalk by the stop where the 66 stops can we please get flashing lights like other crosswalks have in town. Be nice and please if you could fix the highstreet exchange like how the downtown exchange is getting done be awesome for passengers and especially for city of abbotsford.

Thank you,

Subject: Question for Mayor Siemens re Permissive Tax Exemptions

Hi Nancy,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing today with a question for Mayor and Council about the tax exemption guidelines.  I talked with a helpful staff person at the City, but he wasn’t familiar with offices like ours that serve the whole province.

We had hoped to apply for the tax exemption on our leased space since all our costs (rent, staffing, materials, and supplies, etc.) are incurred here in Abbotsford where we serve our local clients. However, we offer all our same services – education, phone support and access to resources – to clients all over the province online. We don’t incur any extra costs to serve them, and they don’t pay anything as all services are free.

Unfortunately, it looks like serving clients online from outside of the Abbotsford city limits skews our numbers and puts us outside of eligibility for the tax exemption. This doesn’t seem fair to me, and I wondered if any other charities like ours have raised this issue. I’ll still submit our application so it’s in the pool and I hope at some point it could be discussed and the eligibility criteria re-visited.

Warm regards,

Christine Petkau
Executive Director

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I would like to bring the closure of a long term Downtown Business to your attention.  I'm sad to say that The Sound of Music has closed their doors for good.  I talked to the owners and one of the main reasons for this was the parking lot across the street changing to all day parking and nowhere for their customers to park.

I'm not sure if they had contacted you about this, because when we discussed it they didn't think there was much point.  I asked them to anyway.

How many more businesses will have to close before the obvious decision to change the lot back to 2 or 3 hour parking?  It's still full every weekday around 8AM with the same cars all day, while the subsidised parking lot half a block away remains mostly empty.

Just thought I'd bring this to your attention.  Call me, I'd love to speak with you (604) 302-6804

Thanks,

Doug Ensink

Subject: Parking Concerns and Request for Further Discussion

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I hope this letter finds you well, and I would like to express my gratitude for the prompt response to my previous communication.

Gordon, I appreciate your attention to the matter at hand, although I believe there may have been a misunderstanding regarding my concerns about downtown parking. My primary worry revolves around the insufficient availability of customer parking, particularly with an entire parking area transformed into all-day parking for business owners and downtown employees.

I would like to draw attention to a viable solution – a parking lot double the size located across the street, which is currently being heavily subsidized by the ABDA. It seems to me that prioritizing business owners and their employees over patrons raises concerns.

Moreover, when business owners and their employees are provided with dedicated parking spaces, they are more likely to utilize those spots, leaving our limited street parking for patrons.

I have already discussed these concerns with Gordon, and I would like to extend an invitation to any council members or the Mayor to reach out to me for a more detailed discussion. I would be more than willing to personally show you the situation on the ground. The most convenient time for a meeting would be between 8 and 9 A.M., as this is when the parking lot across the street is at its peak occupancy (before most downtown businesses open). In contrast, the ABDA-subsidized parking lot, housing the downtown Christmas tree, is typically either empty or only has a few cars during this time.

I believe that a collaborative effort can lead to a solution that addresses the concerns of both business owners and patrons, ensuring a fair and accessible downtown parking environment. I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter and look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Doug Ensink

Dear Doug,

Thank you for your message of November 23, 2023 outlining your concerns with regards to parking in the Historic Downtown, particularly along West Railway Street and at the city owned parking lot opposite your business. You highlighted three primary issues: the insufficient parking for business owners and employees, the two-hour time limit for parking that you find an insufficient supply of, and the all-day parking lot opposite your business that caters for employees and visitors alike. I would also like to thank you for the time you took to have an on-site discussion with me this past week. It was a valuable experience to gain a perspective of the prevailing situation in front of your business.

It is noted that you are primarily concerned about the perceived lack of parking for both business proprietors and their staff. Businesses are responsible to ensure that they provide safety and adequate parking for their clients and staff. City roads specifically those in high volume areas such as in the Historic Downtown, should only be utilized to accommodate short term overflow. Time limited parking increases the flow of traffic in high volume areas, and ensures that there is good turnover for the limited on-street parking resulting in equal access to, and increased patronage of  local businesses. In 2020/21, a parking study of the Historic Downtown was conducted by the City. The outcome of the study showed that the lack of turnover with on-street and off-street parking in the area was a key factor that was detrimental to the availability of adequate parking. Generally speaking, when the occupancy of on-street parking exceeds 85%, drivers generally experience difficulty in finding a parking spot. On the day of our visit, there were a number of probable parking infractions that were apparent to me, and concerning, and will need to be addressed in the short term.

Regarding your concern about the two-hour parking not being available for patrons, we want to assure you that requests to extend the parking time limits are considered, taking into account input from businesses in the vicinity. Requests from residents to increase the parking duration have been shared with the ADBA for their feedback. Recently, the ADBA has expressed their preference for maintaining a two-hour parking limit to encourage parking turnover, which they believe works best for their businesses. They have also cautioned that a three-hour option might lead more Downtown employees to park on the streets, leaving limited space for customers. However, we are open to revisiting this matter with the ADBA to explore options and we will be meeting with them soon.

As you are aware the ADBA went to lengths to rent a large parking lot for employers and employees to use which I understand has now a monthly fee of $25. Any employer or employee in the Downtown area is open to make use of this parking lot on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, it’s not the City’s mandate to provide parking for businesses and in future parking is likely to become more challenging to find, as residential density in the Downtown increases. As you may not be aware, the Montrose Transit Exchange will soon be under construction, and this will bring an increase in foot traffic to the Downtown when complete later next year.

As explained during our visit, the City has the ability to manage parking demand through time-limited free parking which necessitated making our parking lots all-day parking to keep employers and employees from occupying parking stalls in front of shops. And our mandate is to manage this effectively through staged enforcement. Should enforcement not provide the necessary impetus to move off-street, paid on-street parking may be a consideration in the future. However, this comes at a cost to all, therefore voluntary adherence to the parking bylaws is what we would like to encourage at this time, but we will be incrementally increasing parking enforcement during the next few weeks and into the new year to improve turnover and perceived availability.

In closing, we appreciate your feedback and are committed to finding practical solutions to address parking concerns in the Historic Downtown area. As we continue to assess the demand for parking in Historic Downtown, additional changes to parking availability may be under consideration and could be implemented in the future. We are also cognizant of the number of city projects that are ongoing in the Downtown at any moment in time and therefore intend to stagger our projects to minimize negative parking impacts. We have been monitoring occupancy over the past two years and have seen use of the all-day parking lots increase over time.

Thank you for bringing this concern to our attention. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Magda Laljee, Senior Manager Bylaw Services at 604.864.5630 directly, should you wish to discuss this matter further.

Dear Mayor & Council,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed elimination of certain transit services in our area. This change will significantly impact my brother, Neil Poynton, who relies on these services for his daily transportation needs.

Neil has a learning disability which makes it essential for him to have access to reliable public transportation. The specific route/service is Bus 7 which is proposed to be reduced is crucial for him to travel to work, medical appointments, and social activities. Without this service, his ability to maintain independence and participate in the community will be severely compromised.

Public transportation is a vital resource for many individuals with disabilities, providing them with the freedom to navigate their communities, attend appointments, and lead fulfilling lives. The proposed service cuts will create substantial hardships not only for my brother but also for many other individuals who depend on these services.

I kindly urge you to reconsider the decision to eliminate this service. I am confident that there can be alternative solutions that address budgetary constraints without disproportionately affecting vulnerable members of our community. Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in public transportation should be a priority, as it reflects our collective commitment to supporting all members of society.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns. I would be grateful for an opportunity to discuss this matter further and explore potential solutions that could mitigate the impact on my brother and others in similar situations. Please feel free to contact me at 604-217-5255 or poyntonmichelle@gmail.com<mailto:poyntonmichelle@gmail.com>.

I am sending you a strong complaint about this camp.  They have accessed the park through a supposedly locked gate!  This park is directly across from Terry Fox Elementary school!  The neighbourhood children play in this park.  There also softball games and soccer games played there.
We are scared to have our yards and houses unlocked even when we are home.  There must be something that can be done.  I have lived in my home for 34 years and have always felt safe, but that is not so now!

Subject: Homeless camp in Babich Park !?

Hello Mayor,

Apparently a homeless encampment from Gladys Rd has moved into our family neighbourhood at Babich Park, right across the street from my children’s school Terry Fox Elementary.
There has already been bylaw notices sent and officers have come by and “checked on” the camp.
See attachments:

Right behind the baseball diamond

And this letter was shared with some residents in Babich area, were posted on our FB group Babich Neighbourhood Watch.

Please help our neighbourhood stay safe, there are kids on that field, at the school, and all around this quiet neighbourhood.


Thank you,

Why is this OK behavior for our administration.
We want to  educate our children and build them up with the confidence, good values and the truth to be great leaders in this community. Instead, they are producing Sheep who are taught to lie steal and cheap to make themselves look amazing. That's not community and those sheep will never be leaders because they are scared to stand up and voice their opinion even if it's not the same as everyone else's. Our community will remain stagnant until the ""Administration"" stop sweeping things under the carpet and start producing critical thinkers will be great leaders.https://fvcurrent.com/p/robert-bateman-art-activism<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/fvcurrent.com/p/robert-bateman-art-activism__;!!HlipOSu6CkXjIGIpew!UQOABFmwEal9z2zXK5nPgTp99f-soLrYvs7ROHOA3Y8ueI2PcRoeKhrKuX0xxXV7jaJFATYbUXPXjYHkck-3Adve$>

Your finance department is misleading you with your information for decisions. This information is directly from my Abbotsford City Tax bills.

Subject: Homeless Encampment at Babich Park - a concerned resident
?

Dear Mayor Ross Siemens,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the recent establishment of a homeless camp in our neighborhood park (Babich Park) particularly given its proximity to my culdesac and the impact on our community. I'm aware it's been registered as a protest. I'm not sure that relieves any of my concerns.

As a resident living next to the park, I am worried about the safety and well-being of my children, as well as the many families who regularly use this park and the school directly across the street. While I understand and respect the need for shelter and the dignity of every individual, I believe that a park setting is not suitable for a homeless camp due to the potential risks it poses to public health and safety.

I am reaching out to you to seek guidance and action steps on how we can address this situation effectively and swiftly. Here are some specific concerns and questions I have:

  1.  Safety Measures: What measures can be implemented to ensure the safety of park users, especially children and families?
  2.  Alternative Solutions: Are there alternative locations or resources available where these individuals can be provided with more suitable shelter and support services?
  3.  Community Engagement: How can we involve the community in finding a constructive and compassionate resolution to this issue?
  4.  Legal Considerations: What are the local regulations and protocols regarding homeless encampments in public spaces?

I believe it is crucial for us to find a balanced approach that respects the rights and needs of both our community and those experiencing homelessness. I am committed to working together with you to find a solution that ensures the park remains a safe and welcoming place for everyone. I am confident that the use of it for a homeless camp is not intended as that welcoming space.

I look forward to your guidance and assistance in addressing this pressing issue. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Warm regards,

Bonny Wormald

A concerned and confused citizen

Subject: Another wonderful day on hwy 1 !!!


Rob/David

Can you at all understand the frustration we have with your complete disregard to what we go through daily in the Valley.

Machines have been parked for weeks on any possible work done on project and now completed 2036 with no difinative completion season??

OMG!!!

What a failure you guys are!

I am talking this up to everyone I know. Rule of 50 will prevail.

I can't believe the silence on this from others cc'd on this matter!!!

Just follow the arrogance of Justine and everything will eventually fix it's self .



Other concerns,

#1-Who's bonehead idea was it to take the roundabout out at Mt Lehman and Highstreet??

It only take 2 semis wanting to turn left northbound , to back traffic uo past frader hwy south.

On top of this cluster, there has been a major semi distribution center just south of fraser hwy??

Another majot warehouse construction north too.

Unbelievable!

#2- I think this one is for Ross.

Improvements done between Sumas and Old Yale via Maclure.

Who dreamed this plan up?

It's just flat out dangerous now . Especially at top of hill in between Sumas and Old Yale.

Someone will run over whtever that is at tiop of hill.

Also, I am tired of sitting at new 4 way light at Mclure and Old Yale.

Sitting there for minutes while no one is going through Maclure east or west??

Lanes are now also too narrow.

I wish some commen sense was a requirement for being in office!! All of you!

Subject: road repaving projects : George Ferguson Way and Babich

Our houses still shake when vehicles driving along George Ferguson Way near Babich junction. The house-shaking issue has been going on for several years now. After almost 2 years of trying to find the right person to speak to, in the City of Abbotsford, we finally got hold of someone to take some actions. Yes, some temporary repair or repaving have been done on this stretch of road recently on George Ferguson Way.  However, there is one patch of road  by the traffic light George Ferguson Way and Babich and all the way to Fuller Street, north side, is not done.  I was told the traffic light needed to replaced. There is no sight of any new traffic light installation happening so far.  I noticed that a new traffic light had been installed down the other end of George Ferguson Way in the old town area.

Please let us know when is this patch of road going to be repaved?

I want to live in my house with a peace of mind and not constantly hearing the rattling and feeling the house vibrating. After several years of it, I have enough. I am sure my neighbours feel the same.

Dear Mayor Siemens,
I know your daughter, Ashley, from when she taught at our school as an EA.
 I would like to bring a matter to your attention.
The Abbotsford News Paper had a big article entitled ""Former Hotel to become 59-unit emergency shelter"".    The article was good except that they included one paragraph that was not true.  Whoever wrote the article stated or was told that
 ""The restaurant on site will be repurposed to provide meals and other services.""
We are friends with  Paul, the proprieter  of the Crossroads Restaurant on site, and he has told us that this is not true.  He is not part of this change, but this comment has almost killed his business, telling people that he is no longer open to the public.
Can you do something to correct this, so that this man can continue his business?
Thank you very much.

Subject: Babich Park - Abbotsford

Dear Mr. Mayor,



I hope your are doing well. I am emailing you as a concerned citizen and resident in the Babich Park area.



Over the last day or two their has been a group of people that have “moved” into our local community park (see below pictures).  As you can tell from the pictures attached, a group of Homeless advocates have decided to occupy Babich Park.  They have set up tents and somehow got through the city gate (illegally), parking an RV trailer behind the baseball field. This is a Park that is used by our community and has many children playing in it daily as well regular use of the baseball diamond by the Abbotsford Minor Baseball Association. While this occupation of the Park is unacceptable, what is MOST concerning, and the reason for this email, is the fact that the group that is behind this is advocating that the current residents of the homeless camp on Glady’s Ave come to this new place. This has the potential to turn into a much larger problem and cannot be allowed any further, I am asking that this be dealt with swiftly.



I have 4 young children and we play at this park daily. This is a residential area with many young families in the area. This is not the place for a protest, encampment or anytime of homeless community, nor is this fair or safe for the kids in our community.



I appreciate your attention to this matter and am confident yourself and the city will address this immediately.



I am more than willing to meet or have a phone conversation to discuss this further.  My Cell #: 604.309.2620



Thank you,





Mark Buhler

President

?mayor Siemens:

This is concerning the protest at babich park. The tents and people need to be removed. I do not know what the solution can be, but this cannot continue.
I live just down the road from the park. It’s a park for people to use and enjoy!  My 2 young girls (age 5&7) play at the park regularly. Our good friends live just a walk through the trails, that are now littered and needles have been found there.  The park has now become a new campground, how is this ok? More people are supposed to be coming to join the campers which will make the park a mess. I do not feel safe going there, and I fear this will spread to more of the neighbourhood.
Please help stop this before it gets worse!

We petitioned for, and were under the impression that the crosswalk at Harry Sayers Elementary School would include warning lights such as were placed at the Blueridge/Ridgeview crossing. We believe it is imperative, for the safety concerns of small children, that crosswalk must be lit. Will warning lights be placed at that dangerous elementary school crossing?

Once again, thank you for your help in seeing that a safe crossing was installed at the intersection of Blueridge and Ridgeview streets. It is well used. Even more so because there is a bus stop at that intersection. People often cross there on their way to or from the bus.

Sincerely,

Tony Mayo

Hi there – from my reading of this letter, it seems this is a domestic dispute that the city doesn’t have involvement in. Any chance there’s a stock response that your office provides in a case like that?

Two things....I think it is great that a school will be built on Gladwin rather than anything else. My only question is why the school is not inclusive? (or is it?).....Secondly, back when I attended Council meeting for McKee Rd development, I brought an individual file for Mayor, Council and Staff, from an expert about animal extinction for all of you? I wonder if any of you read it? I will be coming in to express my dismay at how Abbotsford does not seem to be taking seriously the harm being done to animals in Abbotsford by them having no means to escape or survive the development happening? As wildlife expert says. we must protect what is left of our wildlife by building to preserve same. Thank you for listening. Diane Davies.

I am disgusted by how your Chief of the Fire Department lied on Global News.

Lie # 1 You say you're apologetic but you do not look very apologetic. You look and sound like someone trying to save his (or someone else's job)

Lie # 2 A spill large enough to kill off entire eco-systems and still remain the following day isn't a small spill.  That is a large spill that went un-noticed or ignoring by your Hall thinking it was unimportant (and God forbid!!) was washing it down the storm drain.

Lie #3 It is hard to believe that your Hall uses a pumping system instead of a pouring system when on the News you can see men removing drums from garbage bins. If in fact you were pumping you would have noticed a spill as it happened and it would have been small. ??

My take on this..... Fire Hall Number 7 needed to get rid of expired fire retardant and some Einstein thought it would be ok to pour it down the drain...

Come clean! (Which is more than we can say for Stoney Creek)

Subject: Opioid Crisis in Abbotsford
?
Hello,

Dear Mayor Siemens, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned resident of Abbotsford regarding the opioid crisis that is devastating our community. In the past week alone, there have been four overdoses on my street, adding to a total of eight since October 2023. Alarmingly, one of these overdoses involved a seventeen-year-old boy. Yesterday there were three overdoses back to back. Today there was another.

I understand that the Abbotsford Police Department has recently acquired an armored vehicle. While I appreciate the importance of maintaining public safety, I am deeply troubled by the apparent disparity between this expenditure and the urgent need to address the opioid epidemic that is claiming lives in our community.

The opioid crisis is a pressing issue that demands immediate and sustained action. Our community members are suffering, and we need a comprehensive and compassionate response to prevent further tragedies. This includes increasing access to addiction treatment and recovery services, providing support for affected families, and implementing effective prevention and education programs.

I urge you to prioritize this critical issue and take decisive action to help our citizens who are struggling with addiction. It is vital that we allocate resources and implement strategies that will have a direct and lasting impact in order to intimate a sustainable solution on reducing overdoses and saving lives.

I am eager to hear what steps you plan to take to address the opioid crisis in Abbotsford and how the community can support these efforts. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Kathleen Adams

I would like the gouging in Abbotsford to stop, today the prices were cheaper in Vancouver than they were in Abbotsford and as the mayor of Abbotsford I would think that you would have something to say about this...  I'm not happy to know that our Mayor is not concerned enough to regulate how business is being conducted in Abbotsford BC... We are already taxed to death and this is completely out of control when gasoline prices in Abbotsford are higher than Metro Vancouver...
I have reached out to you in the past, I have sent you emails regarding this problem and just like every other politician, you have pass the buck and told me that you do not control the gas pricing in Abbotsford... Notes you are also in the gasoline business... well it's about time our Mayor took interest and the concerns of your voters and started to do something to contain this matter...

I will no longer vote for you in the future if something is not done about this immediately this year... It's bad enough we have a carbon tax...

Yours truly Richard Williams

Message for Mayor & Council
Message
I’m very concerned about the increasing impacts of climate change. It is affecting people around the world, and we have been experiencing it locally, with increasing incidents of extreme weather events such as heat domes, drought, cold snaps that killed fruit trees and grape vines, and, of course, flooding. I have daughters and, now, a granddaughter, and I want them to have a chance for a liveable climate, and a planet that isn’t threatened with an increasing number of extinction events.
The IPPC have made it clear that the overwhelming majority of the scientific evidence, and consensus, demonstrates that the world is quickly approaching a tipping point, beyond which nothing we can do will prevent runaway climate change, threatening all life on earth. No other issue is as important as preventing runaway climate catastrophe.
For decades, oil and gas corporations have known that burning fossil fuels would cause the heat waves, wildfires, drought and flooding that we’re now experiencing in BC.
These multinational companies spent millions to deceive, deny and distract us on their way to billions in profit by preventing action on climate change.
We must force oil and gas corporations to change their business practices and pay their fair share for the harm they’re causing.
Abbotsford experienced first hand what it is to be vulnerable to costly climate change impacts with the flooding in 2021. Significant parts of Abbotsford lie within floodplain areas, and senior levels of government have been unable to provide the billions of dollars needed to improve drainage, pump stations or to retreat from flood prone areas. ? It’s neither realistic nor fair that Abbotsford residents are expected to foot the bill for all the climate damage and climate adaptation costs facing our city.
You may have heard the news that Burnaby and Port Moody recently announced that they are committed to working with other local governments to make Big Oil pay for a share of climate costs.

I am writing to Abbotsford council to:


* take urgent action to reduce our fossil fuel use and protect us from future heat waves, wildfires, flooding and other climate impacts;
* set aside at least $1 per person towards a community fund to sue Big Oil;?
* work to build equitable, sustainable systems for transportation, housing and food that put people and the planet before corporate profits;?
* cooperate with Indigenous peoples in doing so; and
* help to recoup climate change-related costs from the world’s largest polluters, by joining with other local governments to file a class action lawsuit to recover a fair share of our climate costs. Abbotsford is one of the largest cities in BC. If Abbotsford joins Sue Big Oil, there will be enough municipalities to go ahead with the lawsuit.?
I beg council to join other BC communities in the class action suit against Big Oil and Gas, to make them pay their fair share of the costs of dealing with climate change damages, and adaptation.

Dear Council Members and Mr. Bryndza,

I am emailing you regarding the property at 617 McKenzie road. In September or October of last year the application for a composting site on McKenzie road was denied and Mr. Dahl was given until November to revert his property back to agricultural only. In November he was given an extension to March, in March he was given an extension to July. The property has still not been cleared and it is almost the middle of July. I have attached a few photos from this morning. The size of the piles has decreased, but I would like to know what the status of the property is and what the city plans to do if he is unable to clear the site prior to the end of this month as he has been given 8 or months to do so already.

Subject: road repaving projects : George Ferguson Way and Babich

Our houses still shake when vehicles driving along George Ferguson Way near Babich junction. The house-shaking issue has been going on for several years now. After almost 2 years of trying to find the right person to speak to, in the City of Abbotsford, we finally got hold of someone to take some actions. Yes, some temporary repair or repaving have been done on this stretch of road recently on George Ferguson Way.  However, there is one patch of road  by the traffic light George Ferguson Way and Babich and all the way to Fuller Street, north side, is not done.  I was told the traffic light needed to replaced. There is no sight of any new traffic light installation happening so far.  I noticed that a new traffic light had been installed down the other end of George Ferguson Way in the old town area.

Please let us know when is this patch of road going to be repaved?

I want to live in my house with a peace of mind and not constantly hearing the rattling and feeling the house vibrating. After several years of it, I have enough. I am sure my neighbours feel the same.

Dear Mayor Siemens,
I know your daughter, Ashley, from when she taught at our school as an EA.
 I would like to bring a matter to your attention.
The Abbotsford News Paper had a big article entitled ""Former Hotel to become 59-unit emergency shelter"".    The article was good except that they included one paragraph that was not true.  Whoever wrote the article stated or was told that
 ""The restaurant on site will be repurposed to provide meals and other services.""
We are friends with  Paul, the proprieter  of the Crossroads Restaurant on site, and he has told us that this is not true.  He is not part of this change, but this comment has almost killed his business, telling people that he is no longer open to the public.
Can you do something to correct this, so that this man can continue his business?
Thank you very much.

This is concerning the protest at babich park. The tents and people need to be removed. I do not know what the solution can be, but this cannot continue.
I live just down the road from the park. It’s a park for people to use and enjoy!  My 2 young girls (age 5&7) play at the park regularly. Our good friends live just a walk through the trails, that are now littered and needles have been found there.  The park has now become a new campground, how is this ok? More people are supposed to be coming to join the campers which will make the park a mess. I do not feel safe going there, and I fear this will spread to more of the neighbourhood.
Please help stop this before it gets worse!

I am disgusted by how your Chief of the Fire Department lied on Global News.

Lie # 1 You say you're apologetic but you do not look very apologetic. You look and sound like someone trying to save his (or someone else's job)

Lie # 2 A spill large enough to kill off entire eco-systems and still remain the following day isn't a small spill.  That is a large spill that went un-noticed or ignoring by your Hall thinking it was unimportant (and God forbid!!) was washing it down the storm drain.

Lie #3 It is hard to believe that your Hall uses a pumping system instead of a pouring system when on the News you can see men removing drums from garbage bins. If in fact you were pumping you would have noticed a spill as it happened and it would have been small. ??

My take on this..... Fire Hall Number 7 needed to get rid of expired fire retardant and some Einstein thought it would be ok to pour it down the drain...

Come clean! (Which is more than we can say for Stoney Creek)

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I would like to bring the closure of a long term Downtown Business to your attention.  I'm sad to say that The Sound of Music has closed their doors for good.  I talked to the owners and one of the main reasons for this was the parking lot across the street changing to all day parking and nowhere for their customers to park.

I'm not sure if they had contacted you about this, because when we discussed it they didn't think there was much point.  I asked them to anyway.

How many more businesses will have to close before the obvious decision to change the lot back to 2 or 3 hour parking?  It's still full every weekday around 8AM with the same cars all day, while the subsidised parking lot half a block away remains mostly empty.

Just thought I'd bring this to your attention.  Call me, I'd love to speak with you (604) 302-6804

Thanks,

Doug Ensink

Subject: Parking Concerns and Request for Further Discussion

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I hope this letter finds you well, and I would like to express my gratitude for the prompt response to my previous communication.

Gordon, I appreciate your attention to the matter at hand, although I believe there may have been a misunderstanding regarding my concerns about downtown parking. My primary worry revolves around the insufficient availability of customer parking, particularly with an entire parking area transformed into all-day parking for business owners and downtown employees.

I would like to draw attention to a viable solution – a parking lot double the size located across the street, which is currently being heavily subsidized by the ABDA. It seems to me that prioritizing business owners and their employees over patrons raises concerns.

Moreover, when business owners and their employees are provided with dedicated parking spaces, they are more likely to utilize those spots, leaving our limited street parking for patrons.

I have already discussed these concerns with Gordon, and I would like to extend an invitation to any council members or the Mayor to reach out to me for a more detailed discussion. I would be more than willing to personally show you the situation on the ground. The most convenient time for a meeting would be between 8 and 9 A.M., as this is when the parking lot across the street is at its peak occupancy (before most downtown businesses open). In contrast, the ABDA-subsidized parking lot, housing the downtown Christmas tree, is typically either empty or only has a few cars during this time.

I believe that a collaborative effort can lead to a solution that addresses the concerns of both business owners and patrons, ensuring a fair and accessible downtown parking environment. I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter and look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Doug Ensink

Dear Doug,

Thank you for your message of November 23, 2023 outlining your concerns with regards to parking in the Historic Downtown, particularly along West Railway Street and at the city owned parking lot opposite your business. You highlighted three primary issues: the insufficient parking for business owners and employees, the two-hour time limit for parking that you find an insufficient supply of, and the all-day parking lot opposite your business that caters for employees and visitors alike. I would also like to thank you for the time you took to have an on-site discussion with me this past week. It was a valuable experience to gain a perspective of the prevailing situation in front of your business.

It is noted that you are primarily concerned about the perceived lack of parking for both business proprietors and their staff. Businesses are responsible to ensure that they provide safety and adequate parking for their clients and staff. City roads specifically those in high volume areas such as in the Historic Downtown, should only be utilized to accommodate short term overflow. Time limited parking increases the flow of traffic in high volume areas, and ensures that there is good turnover for the limited on-street parking resulting in equal access to, and increased patronage of  local businesses. In 2020/21, a parking study of the Historic Downtown was conducted by the City. The outcome of the study showed that the lack of turnover with on-street and off-street parking in the area was a key factor that was detrimental to the availability of adequate parking. Generally speaking, when the occupancy of on-street parking exceeds 85%, drivers generally experience difficulty in finding a parking spot. On the day of our visit, there were a number of probable parking infractions that were apparent to me, and concerning, and will need to be addressed in the short term.

Regarding your concern about the two-hour parking not being available for patrons, we want to assure you that requests to extend the parking time limits are considered, taking into account input from businesses in the vicinity. Requests from residents to increase the parking duration have been shared with the ADBA for their feedback. Recently, the ADBA has expressed their preference for maintaining a two-hour parking limit to encourage parking turnover, which they believe works best for their businesses. They have also cautioned that a three-hour option might lead more Downtown employees to park on the streets, leaving limited space for customers. However, we are open to revisiting this matter with the ADBA to explore options and we will be meeting with them soon.

As you are aware the ADBA went to lengths to rent a large parking lot for employers and employees to use which I understand has now a monthly fee of $25. Any employer or employee in the Downtown area is open to make use of this parking lot on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, it’s not the City’s mandate to provide parking for businesses and in future parking is likely to become more challenging to find, as residential density in the Downtown increases. As you may not be aware, the Montrose Transit Exchange will soon be under construction, and this will bring an increase in foot traffic to the Downtown when complete later next year.

As explained during our visit, the City has the ability to manage parking demand through time-limited free parking which necessitated making our parking lots all-day parking to keep employers and employees from occupying parking stalls in front of shops. And our mandate is to manage this effectively through staged enforcement. Should enforcement not provide the necessary impetus to move off-street, paid on-street parking may be a consideration in the future. However, this comes at a cost to all, therefore voluntary adherence to the parking bylaws is what we would like to encourage at this time, but we will be incrementally increasing parking enforcement during the next few weeks and into the new year to improve turnover and perceived availability.

In closing, we appreciate your feedback and are committed to finding practical solutions to address parking concerns in the Historic Downtown area. As we continue to assess the demand for parking in Historic Downtown, additional changes to parking availability may be under consideration and could be implemented in the future. We are also cognizant of the number of city projects that are ongoing in the Downtown at any moment in time and therefore intend to stagger our projects to minimize negative parking impacts. We have been monitoring occupancy over the past two years and have seen use of the all-day parking lots increase over time.

Thank you for bringing this concern to our attention. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Magda Laljee, Senior Manager Bylaw Services at 604.864.5630 directly, should you wish to discuss this matter further.

Dear Mayor Siemens,
I know your daughter, Ashley, from when she taught at our school as an EA.
 I would like to bring a matter to your attention.
The Abbotsford News Paper had a big article entitled ""Former Hotel to become 59-unit emergency shelter"".    The article was good except that they included one paragraph that was not true.  Whoever wrote the article stated or was told that
 ""The restaurant on site will be repurposed to provide meals and other services.""
We are friends with  Paul, the proprieter  of the Crossroads Restaurant on site, and he has told us that this is not true.  He is not part of this change, but this comment has almost killed his business, telling people that he is no longer open to the public.
Can you do something to correct this, so that this man can continue his business?
Thank you very much.

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I would like to bring the closure of a long term Downtown Business to your attention.  I'm sad to say that The Sound of Music has closed their doors for good.  I talked to the owners and one of the main reasons for this was the parking lot across the street changing to all day parking and nowhere for their customers to park.

I'm not sure if they had contacted you about this, because when we discussed it they didn't think there was much point.  I asked them to anyway.

How many more businesses will have to close before the obvious decision to change the lot back to 2 or 3 hour parking?  It's still full every weekday around 8AM with the same cars all day, while the subsidised parking lot half a block away remains mostly empty.

Just thought I'd bring this to your attention.  Call me, I'd love to speak with you (604) 302-6804

Thanks,

Doug Ensink

Subject: Parking Concerns and Request for Further Discussion

Dear Gordon Botha, Mayor Ross Siemens, and City Council Members,

I hope this letter finds you well, and I would like to express my gratitude for the prompt response to my previous communication.

Gordon, I appreciate your attention to the matter at hand, although I believe there may have been a misunderstanding regarding my concerns about downtown parking. My primary worry revolves around the insufficient availability of customer parking, particularly with an entire parking area transformed into all-day parking for business owners and downtown employees.

I would like to draw attention to a viable solution – a parking lot double the size located across the street, which is currently being heavily subsidized by the ABDA. It seems to me that prioritizing business owners and their employees over patrons raises concerns.

Moreover, when business owners and their employees are provided with dedicated parking spaces, they are more likely to utilize those spots, leaving our limited street parking for patrons.

I have already discussed these concerns with Gordon, and I would like to extend an invitation to any council members or the Mayor to reach out to me for a more detailed discussion. I would be more than willing to personally show you the situation on the ground. The most convenient time for a meeting would be between 8 and 9 A.M., as this is when the parking lot across the street is at its peak occupancy (before most downtown businesses open). In contrast, the ABDA-subsidized parking lot, housing the downtown Christmas tree, is typically either empty or only has a few cars during this time.

I believe that a collaborative effort can lead to a solution that addresses the concerns of both business owners and patrons, ensuring a fair and accessible downtown parking environment. I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter and look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Doug Ensink

Dear Doug,

Thank you for your message of November 23, 2023 outlining your concerns with regards to parking in the Historic Downtown, particularly along West Railway Street and at the city owned parking lot opposite your business. You highlighted three primary issues: the insufficient parking for business owners and employees, the two-hour time limit for parking that you find an insufficient supply of, and the all-day parking lot opposite your business that caters for employees and visitors alike. I would also like to thank you for the time you took to have an on-site discussion with me this past week. It was a valuable experience to gain a perspective of the prevailing situation in front of your business.

It is noted that you are primarily concerned about the perceived lack of parking for both business proprietors and their staff. Businesses are responsible to ensure that they provide safety and adequate parking for their clients and staff. City roads specifically those in high volume areas such as in the Historic Downtown, should only be utilized to accommodate short term overflow. Time limited parking increases the flow of traffic in high volume areas, and ensures that there is good turnover for the limited on-street parking resulting in equal access to, and increased patronage of  local businesses. In 2020/21, a parking study of the Historic Downtown was conducted by the City. The outcome of the study showed that the lack of turnover with on-street and off-street parking in the area was a key factor that was detrimental to the availability of adequate parking. Generally speaking, when the occupancy of on-street parking exceeds 85%, drivers generally experience difficulty in finding a parking spot. On the day of our visit, there were a number of probable parking infractions that were apparent to me, and concerning, and will need to be addressed in the short term.

Subject: Christian Heritage Month Letter - Mayors

Good Day Your Worship Mayor Ross Allan Siemens,

I hope this email finds you in good health.

I am a principal at GTA Strategies, a Lobbying/Consulting firm, and I am reaching out to you on behalf of our client, Christian Heritage Festival. They have asked that we reach out to you and ask your assistance in their campaign to have December recognized across Canada as “Christian Heritage Month”. A letter from Christian Heritage Festival CEO Molly Banerjei is attached with more information.

Christianity is the most followed religion in our country, with more than half of the Canadian population identifying as members of the Christian faith. It has shaped Canada's social, cultural and ethical fabric, with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms mentioning God in the first sentence. With many other faiths receiving dedicated months of recognition, we are seeking to have Christianity receive the same consideration. With that in mind, we are reaching out to municipal councils across Canada to ask for their assistance; the cities of Brampton and Orillia in Ontario have already made this declaration (attached copied for your reference), and we would like to see this goal adopted nationwide.

We would appreciate your guidance on how proclamations can be made within your jurisdiction, including any application forms if they are required. Also, please advise if you would be willing to sponsor a motion in Council to have the month of December declared as “Christian Heritage Month”.

Please advise of your availability in the coming weeks for a brief virtual call to discuss this project. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us directly; I can be reached at jim@gtastrategies.com<mailto:jim@gtastrategies.com>, or by phone at 416-499-4588 ext. 1.
